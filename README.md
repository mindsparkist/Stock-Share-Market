**Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) in India**

Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) refers to the profit earned from the sale of a capital asset that has been held for more than a specified period, typically over a year. These gains are subject to lower tax rates compared to short-term capital gains, making them an attractive option for investors.

**How does LTCG work in India?**

1. **Asset Holding Period:** To qualify for LTCG, the asset must be held for more than 12 months.
2. **Tax Rates:** The LTCG tax rate varies depending on the asset type:
   * **Listed Equity Shares and Equity-Oriented Mutual Funds:**
     * For transfers made on or after July 23, 2024: LTCG exceeding â‚¹1.25 lakh in a financial year is taxed at a 12.5% rate.
     * For transfers made up to July 22, 2024: LTCG is taxed at a 10% rate.
   * **Other Assets (Real Estate, Land, Unlisted Shares, etc.):**
     * For transfers made on or after July 23, 2024: LTCG is taxed at 12.5% without the indexation benefit.
     * For transfers made on or before July 22, 2024: LTCG is taxed at 20% after availing the indexation benefit.
3. **Tax Calculation:** The tax is calculated on the difference between the sale price and the purchase price of the asset.
4. **Exemptions:** There may be certain exemptions available to reduce the taxable amount on your LTCG, such as the basic exemption limit.

**Key Points:**

* The LTCG tax rate for listed equity shares and equity-oriented mutual funds has been increased from 10% to 12.5% from July 23, 2024.
* The indexation benefit, which allowed investors to adjust the purchase price for inflation, has been removed for LTCG on most assets from July 23, 2024.
* It's important to consult with a financial advisor or tax professional for personalized advice on LTCG taxation.

**Remember:** Tax laws can change, so it's crucial to stay updated on the latest regulations.
